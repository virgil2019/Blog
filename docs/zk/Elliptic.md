# Basic Elliptic
## Algebraic
This [article](https://andrea.corbellini.name/2015/05/17/elliptic-curve-cryptography-a-gentle-introduction/) provides an intuitive and detailed explanation of how basic operations(addition and scalar multiplication) on an elliptic work algebraically.  


## Finite Fields
This [article](https://andrea.corbellini.name/2015/05/23/elliptic-curve-cryptography-finite-fields-and-discrete-logarithms/) provides how basic operations(addition and scalar multiplication) on an elliptic work in **finite fields**.
