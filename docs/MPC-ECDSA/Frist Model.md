# MPC-ECDSA : First Model
An MPC-ECDSA is a multi-party's version of the standard ECDSA, which is compatible to the standard signature verifying process, and just makes a magical mathematic variance to the standard signing process, that is, makes it as an aggregable parallel multi-parties Process.  

The references of the *first* model in this article can be found [here](#reference)<sup>[1][2]</sup>.  

## Principle
A [Standard ECDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm) includes $(\mathbb{G}; q; g)$ denoting the group-order-generator tuple associated with the ECDSA curve, private key $x\in \mathbb{F_{q}}$ and related public key $X=g^{x}$ ( actually it's a [scalar multiplication](../zk/Elliptic.md#scalar-multiplication) $x\cdot G$ of the elliptic curve ), $\rho$ the x-projection of point $g^{k^{-1}}\in\mathbb{G}$ where $k$ is a random element of $\mathbb{F_{q}}$, $\sigma=k(m+x\rho)$ where m is the hash of the message to be signed. The signature is $(\rho,\sigma)$. The verification is whether $\rho$ is the x-projection of $g^{m\sigma^{-1}}\cdot X^{\rho\sigma^{-1}}$ ( Actually it's a [addition of two points](../zk/Elliptic.md#addition) in the elliptic curve ).  

In this ariticle, we will introduce s simple model<sup>[2]</sup> transforming the single participant signing into a multi-parties process. In this model, the security threshold is $t=n-1$, that is, all participants follow the protocol.

### Setup(Key Generation)
* For each participant $\mathcal{P_i}$, generate a random $x_i\in\mathbb{F_{q}}$ and sends $X_i=g^{x_i}$ to the public.  
* The global public key is $X=\sum{X_i}\in\mathbb{G}$. And the related global private key is $x=\sum{x_i}$, which is unknown to everyone.  
* For each $\mathcal{P_i}$ defines both the $enc_i$ and $dec_i$ algorithms that are addition homomorphic. The classic [ElGamma Encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm) is one of these algorithms.  
* For each $\mathcal{P_i}$ generate local a share $k_i$ and $\gamma_i$. This makes a global $k=\sum{k_i}$ and $\gamma=\sum{\gamma_i}$, but no one knows them.  
* For each pair of parties $\mathcal{P_i}$ and $\mathcal{P_j}$,  
    * $\mathcal{P_i}$ generates $K_i=enc_i(k_i)$ and sends it to $\mathcal{P_j}$. $enc_i(k_i)$ means encrypting $k_i$ with $\mathcal{P_i}$'s public key $X_i=g^{x_i}$
    * $\mathcal{P_j}$ samples a random $\beta_{j,i}\in\mathbb{F_q}$, calculate $E_{j,i}=(\gamma_j\odot K_i)\oplus enc_i(-\beta_{j,i})=enc_i(\gamma_j k_i - \beta_{j,i})$, and then sends $E_{j,i}$ to $\mathcal{P_i}$. Note that here $\mathcal{P_j}$ uses $\mathcal{P_i}$'s public key to encrypt $-\beta_{j,i}$
    * $\mathcal{P_i}$ calculates $\alpha_{i,j}=dec_i(E_{j,i})=dec_i(enc_i(\gamma_j k_i - \beta_{j,i}))=\gamma_j k_i - \beta_{j,i}$
    * As a result,  $\alpha_{i,j}+\beta_{j,i}=\gamma_j k_i$
* Fro each pair of parties $\mathcal{P_i}$ and $\mathcal{P_j}$, generate $\hat{\alpha_{i,j}}+\hat{\beta_{j,i}}=x_j k_i$ with a similar method.  
* Let's look into $\alpha_{i,j}$ and $\beta_{j,i}$ deeper, for more intuitively, we can express their relationships as matrixes:
    
    $$\left[\begin {array}{cc}
    \alpha_{1,1}&\alpha_{1,2}&...&\alpha_{1,n}\\
    \alpha_{2,1}&\alpha_{2,2}&...&\alpha_{2,n}\\
    \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\
    \alpha_{n,1}&\alpha_{n,2}&...&\alpha_{n,n}
    \end{array}\right]^T + \left[
    \begin{array}{cc}
    \beta_{1,1}&\beta_{1,2}&...&\beta_{1,n}\\
    \beta_{2,1}&\beta_{2,2}&...&\beta_{2,n}\\
    \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\
    \beta_{n,1}&\beta_{n,2}&...&\beta_{n,n}
    \end{array}
    \right] = \left[
    \begin{array}{cc}
    \gamma_1k_1&\gamma_1k_2&...&\gamma_{1}k_{n}\\
    \gamma_{2}k{1}&\gamma_{2}k{2}&...&\gamma_{2}k{n}\\
    \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\
    \gamma_{n}k{1}&\gamma_{n}k{2}&...&\gamma_{n}k{n}
    \end{array}
    \right]$$

    * $\mathcal{P_i}$ only knows the i-th row of matrix $\mathbf{A}$ and the i-th row of matrix $\mathbf{B}$
    * Recall that $\alpha_{i,j}+\beta_{j,i}=\gamma_j k_i$, so the pairing is the i-th row of $A$ and the i-th column of $B$
    * $\alpha_{i,i}=\gamma_{i,i}$ and $\beta_{i,i}=0$
    * $\gamma\cdot k=(\sum{\gamma_i})\cdot(\sum{k_j})=\sum_{i}\sum_{j}{\gamma_{i}k{j}}$, that is the summation of all the elements in both $A$ and $B$
* $\hat{\alpha_{i,j}}$ and $\hat{\beta_{j,i}}$ has a similiar situation, that is $x\cdot k=(\sum{x_i})\cdot(\sum{k_j})=\sum_{i}\sum_{j}{x_{i}k{j}}$ equal to the summation of all the elements in similiar matrixes $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$
* For each $\mathcal{P_i}$, calculate $\delta_{i}=\gamma_{i}k_i+\sum_{j\neq i}{(\alpha_{i,j}+\beta_{i,j})}=\sum_j{(\alpha_{i,j}+\beta_{i,j})}$, that is the i-th row in both $A$ and $B$ which belongs to $\mathcal{P_i}$. And then sends $(\gamma^{i},\delta^{i})$ to public. 
* $\sum{\delta_i}$ is the summation of all elements in both $A$ and $B$. So publicly, everyone can get $g^{k^{-1}}=(\Pi g^{\gamma^{i}})^{(\sum{\delta^j})^{-1}}$, thus abtaining $\rho$  

### Sign
* Similiarly, for each $\mathcal{P_i}$, calculate $\sigma_i=k_{i}m+\rho(x_i k_i+\sum_{j\neq i}{(\hat{\alpha_{i,j}}+\hat{\beta_{i,j}})})$. And then sends to public
* Publicly, everyone can get $\sigma=\sum{\sigma_i}=m\sum{k_i}+\rho(\sum_{j}{(\hat{\alpha_{i,j}}+\hat{\beta_{i,j}})})=km+kx\rho=k(m+x\rho)$. 
* $(\rho,\sigma)$ is the standard signature for the ECDSA.
* Note that both the global random $k$ and global private key $x$ are unknown to anyone, and also the temporary variable global $\gamma$.  

### Verify
The verification is just the same as [standard ECDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm). That is, whether $\rho$ is the x-projection of $g^{m\sigma^{-1}}\cdot X^{\rho\sigma^{-1}}$.
